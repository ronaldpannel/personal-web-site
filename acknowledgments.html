          Franks tutorials always start beginner friendly and then build in
          complicity to include intermediate and advanced concepts.

        <p>
          Franks uses OOP in many of his projects, it was by watching Franks
          tutorials that gave me a understanding of constructor functions, ES6
          classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Frank also introduces more
          advanced Html markup, this channel is not suitable for the absolute
          beginner, you need to know basic javascript fundamentals to benefit
          from Franks tutorials.

          With this Bootcamp Ania does a brilliant job of condensing all the key
          javascript topics down to the minimum no extra unnecessary
          information. On completing Aina's Bootcamp I compiled all the code
          into a word document which as given me a great reference document
          which I continually refer too.
        </p>

        <p>
          Ania's approach to teaching javascript by coding games in the DOM
          demonstrates all the principles of manipulating the DOM. by watching
          and coding along with Ania it helped me see all the principles I had
          learned in the Udemy courses applied and combined to achieve a desired
          end result.
        </p>

        <p>
          The breath of Ania's knowledge based on the wide range of coding
          tutorial subjects on her channel is phenomenal.

          <p>
            Apart from the massive volume of high quality content, it is Daniel
            that makes this channel so good, Daniel's enthusiasm for coding and
            teaching coding is infectious.

      <dialog class="extra-text3">
        <p>
          In Daniels own words this channel is about- <br /><br />
          "All aboard! The Coding Train is on its way with creative coding video
          tutorials on subjects ranging from the basics of programming languages
          like JavaScript to algorithmic art, machine learning, simulation,
          generative poetry, and more. Choo choo!"
        </p>

        <p>
          Daniel uses P5js to teach javascript, although I believe it is
          essential to learn javascript to a reasonable skill level before using
          libraries. However, for creating digital art and visualizations in
          Html canvas working with vectors I consider P5js an exception.
        </p>

        <p>
          P5js significantly reduces the amount of code required when working
          with vectors compared to vanilla javascript. P5js makes applying
          vector maths simple compared to Javascript which would require
          creating a dedicated vector class to handle vector math.
        </p>

        <p>
          Before starting a project Daniel always explains the sometimes complex
          formulas and Algorithms in as simple terms as possible. Daniel then
          demonstrates how to breakdown formulas and Algorithms into manageable
          chunks making converting into code a simpler and more logical process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Daniel always makes sure the resources researched for any of his
          tutorials are well referenced.

          be applied to compiling the code.
        </p>

        <p>
          In some of the tutorials Jessica selects elements that she may not
          fully understand how to code allowing her to demonstrate how she
          researches topics, which is a skill in it's self.

        <p>
          This channel is very good for learning Sass, Jessica uses it in most

          Welcome to the Complete Web Development Bootcamp, the only course you
          need to learn to code and become a full-stack web developer. With
          150,000+ ratings and a 4.8 average, my Web Development course is one
          of the HIGHEST RATED courses in the history of Udemy!
        </p>
        <p>
          t 65+ hours, this Web Development course is without a doubt the most
          comprehensive web development course available online. Even if you
          have zero programming experience, this course will take you from
          beginner to mastery. Here's why:
        </p>
        <p>
          The course is taught by the lead instructor at the App Brewery,
          London's leading in-person programming bootcamp. The course has been
          updated to be 2022 ready and you'll be learning the latest tools and
          technologies used at large companies such as Apple, Google and
          Netflix. This course doesn't cut any corners, there are beautiful
          animated explanation videos and tens of real-world projects which you
          will get to build. The curriculum was developed over a period of four
          years, with comprehensive student testing and feedback.
        </p>
        <p>
          We've taught over a million students how to code and many have gone on
          to change their lives by becoming professional developers or starting
          their own tech startup. You'll save yourself over $12,000 by
          enrolling, but still get access to the same teaching materials and
          learn from the same instructor and curriculum as our in-person
          programming bootcamp. The course is constantly updated with new
          content, with new projects and modules determined by students - that's
          you!
        </p>
        <p>
          We'll take you step-by-step through engaging video tutorials and teach
          you everything you need to know to succeed as a web developer. The
