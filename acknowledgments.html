        <p>
          Franks uses OOP in many of his projects, it was by watching Franks
          tutorials that gave me a understanding of constructor functions, ES6
          classes, inheritance, polymorphism, etc. Frank also introduces more
          advanced Html markup, this channel is not suitable for the absolute
          beginner, you need to know basic javascript fundamentals to benefit
          from Franks tutorials.

          With this Bootcamp Ania does a brilliant job of condensing all the key
          javascript topics down to the minimum no extra unnecessary
          information. On completing Aina's Bootcamp I compiled all the code
          into a word document which as given me a great reference document
          which I continually refer too.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Ania's approach to teaching javascript by coding games in the DOM
          demonstrates all the principles of manipulating the DOM. by watching
          and coding along with Ania it helped me see all the principles I had
          learned in the Udemy courses applied and combined to achieve a desired
          end result.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The breath of Ania's knowledge based on the wide range of coding
          tutorial subjects on her channel is phenomenal.

          <p>
            Apart from the massive volume of high quality content, it is Daniel
            that makes this channel so good, Daniel's enthusiasm for coding and
            teaching coding is infectious.

        <p>
          In Daniels own words this channel is about- <br /><br />
          "All aboard! The Coding Train is on its way with creative coding video
          tutorials on subjects ranging from the basics of programming languages
          like JavaScript to algorithmic art, machine learning, simulation,
          generative poetry, and more. Choo choo!"
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Daniel uses P5js to teach javascript, although I believe it is
          essential to learn javascript to a reasonable skill level before using
          libraries. However, for creating digital art and visualizations in
          Html canvas working with vectors I consider P5js an exception.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          P5js significantly reduces the amount of code required when working
          with vectors compared to vanilla javascript. P5js makes applying
          vector maths simple compared to Javascript which would require
          creating a dedicated vector class to handle vector math.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Before starting a project Daniel always explains the sometimes complex
          formulas and Algorithms in as simple terms as possible. Daniel then
          demonstrates how to breakdown formulas and Algorithms into manageable
          chunks making converting into code a simpler and more logical process.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Daniel always makes sure the resources researched for any of his
          tutorials are well referenced.

          achieving an engaging UI design, and how she creates simple notes
          listing the projects functionality allowing a methodical approach to
          be applied to compiling the code.

        <br />
        <p>
          In some of the tutorials Jessica selects elements that she may not
          fully understand how to code allowing her to demonstrate how she
          researches topics, which is a skill in it's self.

          This channel is very good for learning Sass, Jessica uses it in most

          Hey gang, and welcome to your first step on the path to becoming a
          JavaScript ninja! In this course I'll be teaching you my absolute
          favourite language (JavaScript!) from the very beginning, right
          through to creating fully-fledged, dynamic & interactive web
          experiences.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We'll cover all the basics to get you up-and-running quickly, before
          diving in to some of the really fun stuff like web-page manipulation,
          creating interactive forms, popups & other cool effects. Along the way
          we'll be using the latest additions to the JavaScript specification
          (ES6, 7 & beyond) and maintaining good coding standards to keep our
          code clean and effective!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Once we master the basics, we'll dive into several real-life
          JavaScript projects, including an interactive quiz, a weather app, a
          real-time chat application and a small UI library you can use in all
          your future projects!
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We'll also take a look at some more advanced topics - object oriented
          programming, asynchronous code, real-time databases using Firebase
          (including a new chapter about Firebase 9) and much more. Finally,
          we'll be setting up a modern work-flow using Webpack & Babel, so that
          by the end of this course you'll be no less than a black-belt
          JavaScript developer with a lot of coding techniques in your
          tool-belt.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Speaking of ninjas, I'm also known as The Net Ninja on YouTube, where
          you'll find hundreds of free coding tutorials, so feel free to pop by
          to say hello :).
