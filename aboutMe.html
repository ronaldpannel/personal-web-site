               I spent the majority of my working life employed in the power industry in the following positions: - Mechanical Maintenance Fitter, Mechanical Maintenance Supervisor, Mechanical Maintenance Engineer and the last twenty years as the Tilbury Power Station Maintenance Department Section Head. I also completed a number of secondments at various locations around the UK, Europe and Asia. <br><br>
                On retiring from the power industry, I run my own utilities management company for 5 years before fully retiring.

              After the first year retired, I quickly realized I needed some kind of intellectual stimulation and the importance of keeping the mind and brain active. <br><br>

              I had some experience of  programming PLC's and fault finding control systems from working in industry, although the languages are different the logical thought processes required are the same for fault finding a control system or debugging Javascript code. <br><br>

              I initially had a play with the basics of python and swift but soon realized for hobby purposes this was not the way to go. I wanted something that gave instant results and was easy to distribute across different devices and platforms. <br><br>

              I felt python was a heavy duty language that would be a must learn if you were looking for  a career in data science, AI or computer science in general. Swift is a brilliant language and the resources provided by apple really help accelerate the learning process, however, swift is obviously restricted to the apple eco system. <br><br>

              I then started to look at web development and learning HTML and CSS, initially by watching some random youtube tutorials. Within no time using VS code, a browser and a Github account, I could build a basic static landing page, watch the page develope as I compiled the code and then use Github pages to make sharing my work and accessing it on any device so simple and easy. "I had caught the coding bug" <br><br>

              To progress I needed some structured learning rather than watching random Youtube tutorials. The first Udemy course I purchased was The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp by Dr Angela Yu. This course covers front and back end web development, I can not recommend this course highly enough, the video lessons and supporting learning resources are of the highest quality, Angela's teaching style made working through this course an absolute joy. After completing the Html, CSS, Bootstrap `and Github sections I dropped out of the course to look deeper into HTML and CSS, knowing I would be returning to tackle the dreaded Javascript lessons at some point.<br><br> 

              Focusing on Html and CSS for a while helped me build some muscle memory, learn how to use documentation and Goggle more effectively. I found the power of CSS amazing, how complex animations and visuals can be created without a single line of javascript is mind blowing. Although I  have created some decent animations with pure CSS, a quick look on Code Pen makes me realize I have only scratched the surface of Html and CSS, but know enough to know what I do not know. <br><br>  

              I then returned to The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp and completed the javascript and using the terminal sections, I also had a quick look at some of the other front end lessons such as react, however, I believe I need to have a good understanding of javascript before using libraries so I have some idea of what is happening in the background.   From this point the course moves into the back end which I am definitely not ready for yet. <br><br>

              Although the basics of javascript was slowly starting to sink in it became apparent with javascript there are a multitude of ways to achieve the same result. To get a different take on the subject I purchased the Modern JavaScript (Complete guide, from Novice to Ninja) by Shaun Pelling from Udemy. Again another first class course and teacher. <br><br>

              The problem I am sure happens to most coders at the beginning of their learning journey is when completing course exercises it all seems obvious and clear, as soon as you try to write some original code your mind goes blank. <br><br>

              I then found the YouTube channel Code with Ania Kubow, the breath of Ania's knowledge based on the wide range of coding tutorial subjects on her channel is phenomenal. Ania teaches javascript by coding Javascript games in the DOM, no Html canvas, by watching and coding along with Ania it helped me  see all the principles I had learned in the Udemy courses applied and combined to achieve a desired end result. <br><br>

              On Ania's channel there is a 12hr Javascript Bootcamp which I completed, the course condenses all the key javascript topics down to the minimum no extra unnecessary information. All the code contained in the course I compiled into a word document which I am always referring too. <br><br>

              I realized by now that if I could not create some simple apps no matter how much referencing and goggle searching I had to do on my own I would never progress. <br><br>

              The first apps I created were to help my four year old granddaughter with her spelling and maths. I created two math apps and a spelling app with text to speech, the text to speech element was totally new but with some research, goggling and youTubing getting it to work was very rewarding. <br><br>
              
              However, the most rewarding part was seeing my granddaughter totally engrossed practicing her spelling and sums on a App I had created. Just before writing this I looked at the code I wrote for these apps and to say it is ugly is an understatement.
              <br><br>

              So where am I now after close to 2 years on this journey, at the moment I am spending time creating animations and games with Html canvas using object oriented programming (OOP), creating visuals based on number sequences and algorithms found in nature. <br><br>

              There are many brilliant people who have unknowingly helped me on my coding journey, I have tried to reference as many as possible in the acknowledgments section.
